# Geoid-Undulation-in-Carpathians

This repository aims to determine a local geoid model for Carpathian Mountains based on the known topographic height and assessing the precision performance of the Earth gravitational model (EGM2008) in the area of interest. The topographical points used in this task were received during the Topex satellite altimeter mission. Ellipsoidal heights were then converted into orthometric and geoid elevations with UNAVCO online notebook. Carpathians local geoid was visualized with a map. We also developed a function to model geoids prime profiles.
